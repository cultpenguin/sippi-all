MPSlib: A C++ class for MPS simulation
======================================


MPSlib provides a C++ class, and a set of algorithms for simulation of
models based on a multiple point statistical (MPS) models inferred from
a training image:

- **ENESIM** [GUARDIANO]_. 
- **Generalized ENESIM** [HANSEN2016]_.
- **Direct Sampling** [MARIETHOZ2010]_.
- **SNESIM using tree structures** [STREBELLE2002]_.
- **SNESIM using list structures** [STRAUBHAAR2011]_.

The algorithms
==============
These simulation methods are implemented in two types of algorithms that differ in the way information is inferred from the training image. ENESIM type algorithms samples directly from the training image during simulation, while SNESIM type algorithms scan the training image prior to simulation, and stores the statistics in memory. 

- GENESIM:: :doc:`mps_genesim <Algorithms/chapGenesim/mps_genesim>`

:doc:`mps_genesim <Algorithms/chapGenesim/mps_genesim>` is an implementation of the generalized ENESIM algorithm [GUARDIANO]_. It can run as a pure **ENESIM** algorithm, in which the whole training image is scanned at each iteration, or it can run as a Direct Sampling **DS** algorithm [MARIETHOZ2010]_, in which the training image is scanned for the first matching event. It can can also run as generalized ENESIM **GENESIM** algorithm in which the training image is scanned for the first N matching event [HANSEN2016]_. 

- SNESIM:: :doc:`mps_snesim_tree <Algorithms/chapSnesim/mps_snesim>`/:doc:`mps_snesim_list <Algorithms/chapSnesim/mps_snesim>` 

Two types of SNESIM type simulation methods are implemented. 

:doc:`mps_snesim_tree <Algorithms/chapSnesim/mps_snesim>` stores statistics from the training image in a *tree structure*, as proposed by [STREBELLE2002]_
.
:doc:`mps_snesim_list <Algorithms/chapSnesim/mps_snesim>` stores statistics from the training image in a *list structure*, as proposed by [STRAUBHAAR2011]_.

`mps_snesim_tree`and `mps_snesim_list` differ only in how the information from the training image is store in memory. 

Conditional data
----------------
All algorithms can handle hard and co-loccated soft data. ``mps_genesim`` can also handle non-colocated soft data  [HANSEN2018]_.

Entropy
-------
The entropy of the (unknown) probability distribution related to a specific choice of 1) training image, 2) simulation algorithm, and 3) options for running the simulation algorithm, can optionally be computed as part of simulation. [HANSEN2020]_.

.. Estimation
.. ----------
.. All algorithms can otionally be run in *estimation* mode in which the 1D marginal conditional distribution is directly computed (similar to Etype statistics from a number of realizations) [JOHANNSSON2019]_.



.. see :ref:`ref-snesim`.

PYTHON and MATLAB interface
---------------------------
Interfaces to :doc:`Matlab/Octave interface <../matlab-interface>` and :doc:`Python <../python-interface>` are available.

Code
====

The latest stable code can be downloaded from
http://ergosimulation.github.io/mpslib/.

The current development version is available through GitHub at
https://github.com/ergosimulation/mpslib/.


Background
==========

The goal of developing these codes has been to produce a set of
algorithms, based on sequential simulation, for simulation of multiple
point statistical models. The code should be easy to compile and extend,
and should be allowed for both commercial and non-commercial use.

MPSlib (version 1.0) has been developed by
`I-GIS <http://www.i-gis.dk/>`__ and `Solid Earth Physics, Niels Bohr
Institute <http://imgp.nbi.ku.dk/>`__.

Development has been funded by the Danish National Hightech Foundation
(now: the Innovation fund) through the ERGO (Effective high-resolution
Geological Modeling) project, a collaboration between
`IGIS <http://i-gis.dk/>`__, `GEUS <http://geus.dk/>`__, and `Niels Bohr
Institute <http://nbi.ku.dk/>`__.


Design
======
Details about the design of the mpslib C++ class can be found in [HANSEN2016]_. (`link <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711016300164>`_).

Briefly described, the main class is the ``MPSalgorithm`` class, which implements the sequential simulation algorithm (using multiple girds), methods for reading and writing 3D gridded data, methods for reading known data values (known as hard and soft data), and methods for establishing a data neighborhood, and controlling the simulation path.

Two subclasses, ``ENESIM`` and ``SNESIM`` extends ``MPSalgorithm`` to allow ENESIM and SNESIM type simulation. Finally, the three core algorithms are implemented based on these classes.
