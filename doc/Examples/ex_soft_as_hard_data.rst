=======================
Ex: Soft/uncertain data
=======================
MPSlib can take 'soft' data into account. 'soft' data is defined as uncertain and spatially independent information about one ore more model parameters. Formally the soft information is quantified by :math:`f_{soft}(\mathbf{m})` as

.. math::
   f_{soft}(\mathbf{m}) & \sim f_{soft}(m_1, m_2, m_3, ..., m_M)\\
   & = f_{soft}(m_1) \  f_{soft}(m_2) \ ... \  f_{soft}(m_M)\\
   & = \prod_i^{M} f_{soft}(m_i)
   :label: soft_ind


   
The assumption of spatial independence is critical. If the uncertain information is in fact spatially dependent (as is typically the case using soft data derived from inversion of geophysical data),  the variability in the generated realizations will be too small, such the apparent information content is too high.


MPSlib allow conditioning to both co-located soft data (mps_snesim_tree and mps_genesim) and non-co-located soft data (mps_genesim). The implementation of soft in MPSlib is described in detail in in [HANSEN2018]_.


--------------------
Co-located soft data
--------------------
The usual approach to handling soft data, is to conisder on co-located soft data during sequential simulation. This means that at each iteration of sequential simulation one sample from 

.. math::
   f(m_i | I_{hard}, I_{soft}) = f_{TI}(m_i | \mathbf{m}_c) * f_{soft}(m_i) 
      

As demonstrated in [HANSEN2018]_ the use of a unilateral or random path using co-located soft data leads to ignoring most of the soft information. The problem is most severe when using scattered soft data.
If in stead a simulation path is chosen where more informed nodes (where the entropy of the soft data i high) are visited preferentially to less informed nodes, then much more of the soft data is being taken into account. 

The default path in MPSlib is therefore the `preferential` path, that can selected as the path type `2` in the parameter file. The second parameter controls the randomness of the preferential path.

--------------------
Non Co-located soft data
--------------------
If soft information is scattered, and located relatively far away from each other, then using only co-located soft data my work well. But, when soft information is more densely available, using only co-located soft data results in disregarding available information.

`mps_genesim` can handle non-colocated soft information running both in ENESIM mode (using >1 match in the training image) and Direct Sampling mode  (using only 1 match in the training image). In both cases one samples from the following conditional distribution during sequential simulation:

.. math::
   f(m_i | I_{hard}, I_{soft}) = f_{TI}(m_i | \mathbf{m}_c) * \prod_{j=1}^{Nc_{soft}} f_{soft}(m_j) 

where :math:`Nc_{soft}` refer to the number of (the closest) soft conditional points to use. This number of defined right next to the maximum number of hard data used for condisioning. In the example below, the closest 25 hard and 3 soft data is used

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   Number of realizations # 1
   Random Seed (0 `random` seed) # 1 
   Maximum number of counts for condtitional pdf # 1
   Max number of conditional point: Nhard, Nsoft# 25 3
   Max number of iterations # 1000000
   ...

Figure :numref:`nonco_prefpath` shows the point wise mean of 100 realizations using a sequential, random and preferential simulation path (from `mpslib_hard_as_soft_data.py <https://github.com/ergosimulation/mpslib/blob/master/scikit-mps/examples/mpslib_hard_as_soft_data.py>`_) using two non-colocated soft data.

Note how the sequential and random path can in principle be used, as part of the soft data is used at each iteration, but that the simulation time is dramatically higher than using the preferential path (10 to 20 times faster). The speed is us due to the simulation of the nodes of the soft data the start of the simulation. When the soft data has been simulated, the will in effect be treated as previously simulated hard data, and hence the simulation will perform as normal conditional sequential simulation.
