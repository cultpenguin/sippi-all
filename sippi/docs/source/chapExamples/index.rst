Examples
========

Perhaps the simplest approach to learn using SIPPI is by trying out (and
alter) an example.

`A priori models <chapExamples_prior.md>`__

Examples of different types of a priori models

`Line fitting <chapExamples_linefitting.md>`__

Probabilistic polynomial regression

`Cross-hole GPR tomographic inversion <exGPR/README.md>`__

An example of 2D/3D inversion of crosshole traveltime data obtained from
GPR measurements from Stevns, Denmark. (The case examined in `Hansen et
al. (2013b) </bibliography.md>`__).

`Covariance model inference <chapExamples_CovarianceInference.md>`__

An example of inference of covariance model parameters, from either
direct observations of model parameters, of from linear average
observations (such as data related to an linear inverse problem).
